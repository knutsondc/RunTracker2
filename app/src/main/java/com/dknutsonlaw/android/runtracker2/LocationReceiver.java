/*
  Created by dck on 9/6/15 for RunTracker2.
  added by dck 1/15/2015 to original RunTracker program.
  A subclass of Broadcast Receiver to receive Location updates for use in updating the database,
  with separate instantiations to provide "live" updates directly to the UIs in RunFragment and
  RunMapFragment.

  2/12/2015
  No longer used for "live" UI updates after implementation of MyLocationListCursorLoader that
  supplies "live" updates from the database, so the only instance left is TrackingLocationReceiver
  that supplies Location updates to the database.
