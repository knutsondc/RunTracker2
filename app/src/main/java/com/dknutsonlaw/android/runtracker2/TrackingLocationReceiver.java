  Created by dck on 1/14/15.

  This receiver is statically registered in AndroidManifest.xml, where it has an IntentFilter that
  causes it to respond to Intents created with the ACTION_LOCATION identifier in RunManager.java
  and used in the PendingIntent used to request location updates.This receiver should run even
  if the UI elements of the program are in the background or even destroyed.

  8/25/2015 - added accuracy check on Location updates - trying to get around the "jumpiness" of
  the GPS when it first starts.

  8/28/2015 - Limited accuracy checks on location updates to gps provider; all locations from the
  test provider have an accuracy of 100.0.

  11/5/15 - Made changes due to switch to Google's FusedLocationProvider: We reject all location
  updates that don't have an Altitude value. As the Network Provider's reports don't include an
  Altitude value, this limits the updates recorded to the database to those coming from GPS.
